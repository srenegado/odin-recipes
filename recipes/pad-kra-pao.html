        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A spicy and earthy staple for Thai home cooking.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>300 g ground pork (sub. beef or chicken)</li>
            <li>5 (more or less) thai red chilli peppers, minced</li>
            <li>5 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>A package of thai basil leaves
            (sub. holy basil or italian basil)</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil to coat pan</li>
            <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 sunny side up egg to serve</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a pan medium-high for about a minute. Saute
            the minced garlic and peppers in oil and stir until the garlic
            turns golden.
            </li> 
            <li>Add the ground pork and stir and break up the meat until
            there's no big clumps and the size of the meat is even throughout.
            </li>
            <li>Add the sauces and continue stirring until well-combined
            and the meat is fully cooked. (Add water bit-by-bit if the 
            sauce is too dry until desired consistency.)
            </li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and toss in the basil leaves until 
            fully wilted.
            </li>
            <li>Serve with steamed white rice and a fried egg.</li>
        </ol>
